          <h3>Company history</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            So, the reason I started my company making ergonomic keyboards is
            because I used to experience a lot of pain and discomfort in my
            hands and wrists after typing for long periods of time on a regular
            keyboard. I did some research and discovered ergonomic keyboards,
            which are designed to reduce strain and improve comfort during
            extended typing sessions. The problem was, I found that the options
            on the market were pretty limited and often too expensive. So, with
            my background in engineering and product design, I decided to create
            my own company focused on designing and manufacturing high-quality,
            ergonomic keyboards that were more affordable and accessible to
            everyone. I spent a lot of time testing different materials and
            designs, and working with ergonomics experts to make sure my
            keyboards were the best they could be. And finally, after months of
            hard work, I launched my company and released my first line of
            ergonomic keyboards, which quickly gained a following among
            professionals who valued their health and comfort. Since then, my
            company has grown and expanded to include a range of ergonomic
            accessories, like wrist rests and ergonomic mice. And today, we're
            recognized as a leader in the ergonomic keyboard market, with a
            reputation for quality, innovation, and affordability.

          <h3 class="mt-3">Why? Ortholinear Keyboards.</h3>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/ortholinear-keyboards/p-48-transformed.png" alt="">
          <p class="lead">
            Ortholinear keyboards are designed with the keys arranged in a grid,
            rather than the staggered layout found on traditional keyboards.
            This layout can be beneficial for a few reasons, even though
            ortholinear keyboards typically have fewer keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, the ortholinear layout makes it easier to reach keys
            accurately and consistently, since the keys are arranged in straight
            rows and columns. This can result in a more efficient typing
            experience, with fewer errors and less strain on the hands and
            fingers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, the ortholinear layout can make it easier to use multiple
            layers of key functions, allowing you to access more commands and
            shortcuts without cluttering up the keyboard with extra keys. This
            can be especially useful for programmers, gamers, or anyone who
            needs to use a lot of different keyboard commands in their work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, some people simply find the ortholinear layout more
            comfortable to type on, since it can reduce the amount of hand and
            finger movement required to reach different keys. This can be
            especially beneficial for those with repetitive strain injuries or
            other hand and wrist issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, while ortholinear keyboards may have fewer keys than traditional
            keyboards, their unique layout and potential benefits make them a
            popular choice for many users.

              class="img-fluid"
              src="img/Stagerred/stag-38-ergo-custom-transformed.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              According to research, split keyboards can be beneficial for those
              who type frequently or for long periods of time. One of the main
              advantages of split keyboards is that they allow each hand to be
              positioned independently, reducing strain and tension on the
              hands, wrists, and forearms.
            </p>
            <p>
              This ergonomic benefit can be especially useful for people with
              repetitive strain injuries or other hand and wrist issues. Split
              keyboards can also encourage a more natural and comfortable typing
              posture, with the shoulders relaxed and the arms positioned at a
              more natural angle, which can help reduce strain on the neck,
              shoulders, and back.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to these ergonomic benefits, split keyboards can be
              more customizable and versatile than traditional keyboards. Many
              split keyboards come with programmable keys or multiple layers of
              key functions, allowing users to create shortcuts and macros that
              can save time and improve productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, according to the research, split keyboards can offer a
              more comfortable and ergonomic typing experience for those who
              spend a lot of time typing.
